# Validator Helper Classes for Flow Applications
This package provides some validators to be used in a [Flow](https://flow.neos.io/) based project.

## Included validators

- Domain-Names


## Usage
to be written...

## Credits
This package's code is heavily inspired by code I wrote years ago for the [Roketi Cluster Hosting Management](https://github.com/roketi) application. Thanks to open-source, this code can now live on - while Roketi in the planned form will probably never come to fly.

Thanks to the inspiration from the [phenaproxima/domain-constraint](https://github.com/phenaproxima/DomainConstraint) package, the domain name validator now also checks against the [list of allowed top-level domains defined by IANA](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/files).

Yes, please! And if you save some of your precious time with it, I'd be very happy if you give something back - be it a warm "Thank you" by mail, spending me a drink at a conference, [send me a post card or some other surprise](http://www.rimann.org/support/) :-)
